                <h2>Konstantin Korotkov</h2>
                <h3>Business Strategy, R&D</h3>
                <span>Konstantin is an engineering pro, originally from Belarus. After graduating from Belarussian State University, where he studied radiophysics, Konstantin moved to Germany. He worked since then at Infineon/Qimonda as a test engineer, later the company sent him to the USA, where he worked for two years as a senior expert. Having collected plenty of experience in world-wide distributed multicultural teams, big projects and production environments, after returning back to Germany he decided to begin an own entrepreneurial activity, and started a new project as an external project lead at Siemens. After Alexey joined him in this project, they founded their own company – Labs64 GmbH. Now Konstantin captains the Labs64 engineering flagship. When he is not on the captain’s bridge, you can find him in mountains.</span>
