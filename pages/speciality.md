                <h2>Backup & Restore</h2>

                <span>It is easy to find a whole bunch of professional backup solutions for almost every IT platform. When it comes to backups of a system that is already in place, however, individual solutions are quite often necessary. Not only do our experts understand how backup software works, they are also able to develop the perfect backup strategy for your servers, operating systems, databases and applications. Moreover, many network appliances that are not supported by standardised backup software can be included in your solution, too.</span>
